Q3. Explain the use of grid-auto-row and grid-auto-column using code examples.

Ans:- 'grid-auto-row' and 'grid-auto-column' are properties in CSS Grid Layout that define the size of implicitly-created rows and columns in a grid container. These 	properties are useful when the number of rows or columns is not explicitly defined in the CSS grid but instead created automatically to accommodate content.

	For example refer: - 03_grid_auto.html
	
	In this example:

	- grid-auto-rows	: 50px; sets the height of implicitly created rows to 50 pixels.
	- grid-template-columns	: 100px 100px; explicitly defines two columns each with a width of 100 pixels.
	- Each div with the class grid-item will be placed in the grid, and since the number of rows isn't defined explicitly, rows are created implicitly.
	- Uncommenting grid-auto-columns: 50px; will set the width of implicitly created columns to 50 pixels.

	By adjusting these properties, you can control the layout of your CSS grid and ensure that it accommodates content dynamically.

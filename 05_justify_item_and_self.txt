Q5. Explain the difference between justify-items and justify-self using code examples.

Ans:-
	In CSS Grid, `justify-items` and `justify-self` are properties used to align grid items along the horizontal axis (inline axis). However, they are used in 	slightly different contexts:

	1. justify-items:
   		- This property is used to align all grid items within their respective grid tracks along the inline axis (horizontal axis).
   		- It applies to the entire grid container.
   		- It sets the alignment for all the grid items unless overridden by `justify-self` for individual items.

	2. justify-self:
   		- This property is used to align individual grid items within their respective grid cells along the inline axis.
   		- It applies to individual grid items.
   		- It allows you to override the alignment set by `justify-items` for specific items.

	Here's an example to illustrate the difference (refer 05_justify.html): 


	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
	    <meta charset="UTF-8">
	    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	    <title>Justify</title>
	    <style>
	        .container{
	            display: grid;
	            grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;
	            border: 1px solid black;
	            justify-items: center;
	        }

	        .container > div {
	            padding: 5px;
	            background-color: bisque;
	            border: 1px solid black;
	        }
	    </style>
	</head>
	<body>
	    <div class="container">
	        <div class="box1">Box 1</div>
	        <div class="box2">Box 2</div>
	        <div class="box3">Box 3</div>
	        <div class="box4">Box 4</div>
	        <div class="box5">Box 5</div>
	        <div class="box6">Box 6</div>
	    </div>
	</body>
	</html>


	In this example:

		You see above grid items arranged center along the inline axis, within their respective grid cells.

		This property allows us to set the default way of justifying each item in their respective grid cells.

	justify-self and align-self properties control the alignment of any specific grid item within its grid cell along the horizontal and vertical axis. 	,respectively.The values can be a start, end, center, or stretch.
